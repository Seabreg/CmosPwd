CmosPwd is a cmos/bios password recovery tool.
CmosPwd is under GNU Public License. You can freely distribute it.
It can be compiled under Dos, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.

Platforms
- Dos-Windows version
Well, ... it works!

- Linux && BSD version
Users can work on cmos backup but they need root priviledge to
use ioperm function to have full access to cmos.

- Windows NT, 2000, XP, 2003
To work on cmos memory, ioperm need to be installed and running.
ioperm gives direct port I/O access for specified ports to user-mode process
(ring 3) using Ke386SetIoAccessMap and Ke386IoSetAccessProcess kernel functions.

1- You need administrator priviledges to install this driver
"ioperm.exe -i"
2- Start the service if needed with "net start ioperm"
3- Run "Cmospwd_win.exe"

WARNING: You should disable or uninstall ioperm
with "ioperm.exe -u" if you don't want to decrease
your security!

---------------------------------------------------
¦  Typical Usage for DOS and all Windows users    ¦
---------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------

1)  Identify your BIOS manufacturer (usually displayed at boot-up)

2)  Start in DOS, or start a DOS session in Windows 95/98/ME.
    For Windows NT or Windows 2000 boot from a DOS or Windows 95/98 boot
    disk  (you can find boot disks at www.AnswersThatWork.com), and run
    CMOSPWD from your boot floppy (or another floppy).

3)  C:              [Enter]
    cd \CMOSPWD    [Enter]
    
4)  Type  CMOSPWD  at the DOS prompt and press Enter.

5)  CMOSPWD will display a list of possibilities.  Use the possibilities
    itemised against your BIOS manufacturer.
    Remember :
    
         a)  For AWARD BIOSes, use the Numeric Keypad (with NumLock ON).
         b)  AWARD 4.50PG BIOS always accepts  "AWARD_SW", or "d8on", 
             or "589589".
         c)  Old Phoenix BIOSes will accept  "phoenix".
       
6)   If the standard method does not work, then try to kill
     the CMOS password with  CMOSPWD /K  (and press Enter), 
     and then see if you can get into the CMOS without a password.
     If you can, you successfully "killed" the old CMOS password.
     DO NOT KILL THE CMOS ON LAPTOPS!

On laptops, the password is usually stored in an eeprom on the motherboard,
you need an eeprom programmer (electronic device) to retrieve it.

controler it is in the down side of the bord

VAIO PCG-FX150, eeprom 24c04 near the reference IC1103
VAIO PCG-GRX560, eeprom 24c04 near the reference IC1001

You can get/buy eeprom programmer in electronic shops or labs, you need
another PC to use it.
You can desolder the eeprom with hot air or you can try to "clip" the
eeprom. With the eeprom programmer, backup your eeprom and run
"cmospwd /d /l eeprom_backup". If you don't see the password, you can try
to fill the eeprom with zero or FF, don't forget the reset the cmos.

Differents passwords give the same 32-bit CRC, so CmosPwd can only give one
of them.
To reset the password of an old Toshiba, you can use KeyDisk. (cf my web page)
If this doesn't work, you can try to build the Toshiba Parallell loopback.
To make a simple device that you connect to your parallell port, a lot of
Toshiba computers remove the password when you boot it up.
The device, named "loopback" by some, could be made out of any
parallell wire with 25pins connectors (db25). You should connect
these pins: 1-5-10, 2-11, 3-17, 4-12, 6-16, 7-13, 8-14, 9-15, 18-25.

A db25 looks like:
1    13
_______
\_____/
14   25

What to do if you can't use cmospwd to clear your cmos ?
Under Dos/Win9x, you can use debug to reset cmos CRC stored at 0x2E-0x2F
debug
-o 70 2E
-o 71 0
-q


 
What to do if cmospwd don't work on your PC ?

Try to clear password with cmospwd /k.
If cmospwd /k doesn't work, password is stored in an EEPROM. Try to find a
reset jumper on your motherboard or contact your PC vendor.
If it works, I can try to discover how passwords are encrypted.
I need to know what Bios you used and
some cmos memory backup with their passwords. (cmospwd /w backupfile)
For passwords, choose
- some 1 and 2-letter passwords
- BBBBBBB
- BBBBBBC
- BBBBBCB
- BBBBCBB
- BBBCBBB
- BBCBBBB
- BCBBBBB
- CBBBBBB
